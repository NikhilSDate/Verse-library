what would be the optimal response?

add more variation, take something that's reasonable
rank them by how bad they are

drill down, confirm w/ pump

we can say we found unsafe scenario

switching profiles makes it lose state

dramatic jumpts: 200 to 40 
there is bias, full dropout

sensor corrects to the average when calibrating
but the pump does not account for this

pump is not perfect: great for making the case 



scenarios
- "sleeping beauty": CGM dropout shuts off extended bolus
- basal IQ continues delivering insulin even if G increasing and below target
