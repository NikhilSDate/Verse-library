goal is to find bugs
"bug" condition is too high/too low

"integrate it": 

real problem is if this happens when asleep

type 1: look at possible scenarios w/ simulator: 
    "bug" is that these parameters are adjustable by the simulator
    at what point do "warnings" pop up, will it refuse to deliver a dose

type 2: take a interesting vulnerability/conjectured vulnerability and see what happens
    CGM vulnerability
    phone vuln

type 3 vulnerability: an actual bug/real vulnerability (eliminate using exhaustive testing)

if you use default params, can bad things happens
type 2: user error, can bad things happen
type 3: you did everything right, but still vulnerability

if type 3: can claim that this should be part of FDA analysis
type 2: should detect when phone has been compromised
    are there behaviors that are always fatal/99% fatal
