What needs to be white box?

@Erkai Yu we were thinking we could schedule a meeting sometime this week to bring you up to speed on what's been happening on the insulin pump project and talk about next steps. 

@balex @Kirill Levchenko I think we are going to have to reschedule our 6 PM Thursday meeting because it conflicts with weekly SIGPwny meetings (which are 6 - 7 PM Thursdays). Does 5 PM Thursday work? Also, @balex could you add @Richard and @Erkai to the meeting invite?
