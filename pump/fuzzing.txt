Idea: prove upper/lower bounds for TIR across scenarios

Inputs/scenarios:

personal profile (this can actually also be done through continuous verification)

Number of meals / times of meals

meal "types", 

bolus schedule (simple/extended): this also includes things like forgetting boluses

does the user deliver corrections and if so, at what time (x minutes after meal)

max bolus setting

max hourly bolus setting

patient id

user error in "carb counting"

CGM error

"rescue carbs" when glucose < some value w/ some frequency

presence/absence of exercise

quick bolus/temp rate





for each meal, does the user forget to 

User decision (user performs a correction bolus, user )
